### VENDER ACTION PLAN

What companies should I focus on? _I don't really understand how this question is realted to the vender action plan visualization, can you please give an example_

Data visualised: Number of companies by category in a bar chart. 3 categories: Monitor, Review, Escalate _Are these categories ordinal?_

Insight gained: This visualization only offers the comparison between these three categories, hence detecting the lowest and the highest. Does this already helps to reply to the question of which company to focus on? More context would allow for more comparison and therefore allow to distract more useful, powerful insights. Way to add context: What about temporal context, evaluatuion over time or having a KPI evaluation by the three categories instead of only looking at the number of companies, having a benchmark of how distribution behaves in other makets > benchmark.

Improvement of the current visualiztion: Dont' show numbers by default, if really necessary only as detail on demand hence activated by click or hover. Don't use rounded corner for the bars, makes it visually more difficult to compare them. As we only look at three categories at the moment, vertikal are esier to compare, put them close to each other with nearly no padding. Delete all the unnecessary text like the word COMPANY plus the number as already explained below - appeared three times. Replaced the word VIEW with a small icon that indicates that user clicks if a detailed look is desired, this icon should be used across all visualization. Delete the colors, they dont help much in this visualization and distract from other colors in the neighbour visualization. Only if the colors mean an identity which will be reused later, they might be useful.
